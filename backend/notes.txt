dotenv - dotenv is a zero-dependency module in Node.js that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. 
This allows you to separate secrets from your source code. 
This is useful in a collaborative environment where you may not want to share your database login credentials with other people.
Instead, you can share the source code while allowing other developers to create their own .env file.
